Create a file called `.gitignore` in `C:\Users\Snowy\teacher\` with this content:
```
node_modules
key.env
.env
client/node_modules
```

**PART 3 — Build the React app**

In PowerShell:
```
cd C:\Users\Snowy\teacher\client
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with the production version of your site.

**PART 4 — Push to GitHub**

1. Download Git from **git-scm.com** if you don't have it (just install with all defaults)
2. Go to **github.com**, click the **+** in the top right, click **New repository**
3. Name it `pregrade`, keep it **Public**, don't add a README, click **Create repository**
4. In PowerShell run these commands one at a time:
```
cd C:\Users\Snowy\teacher
git init
git add .
git commit -m "pregrade initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pregrade.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username. It'll ask you to log in the first time.

**PART 5 — Deploy on Render**

1. Go to **render.com** and click **Get Started for Free**
2. Sign up with your **GitHub account** (easiest)
3. Once logged in, click **New** at the top, then **Web Service**
4. It'll show your GitHub repos — select **pregrade**
5. Fill in these settings:
   - **Name:** `pregrade`
   - **Region:** pick the closest one to you (Ohio or Oregon)
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Build Command:** `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `node server.js`
   - **Instance Type:** Free
6. Click **Advanced** and add an environment variable:
   - **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** your actual OpenAI API key (the `sk-...` key)
7. Click **Create Web Service**

It'll take a few minutes to build. When it's done you'll get a live URL like `https://pregrade.onrender.com`.

---

**PART 6 — Connect a custom domain (optional)**

1. In your Render dashboard, click your pregrade service
2. Go to **Settings** then scroll to **Custom Domains**
3. Click **Add Custom Domain** and type your domain (like `pregrade.com`)
4. Render will give you DNS records (usually a CNAME)
5. Go to your domain registrar (Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.) and add those DNS records
6. Wait a few minutes for it to propagate — then your domain is live with free SSL

---

**To update your site later**, just edit your files locally, then run:
```
cd C:\Users\Snowy\teacher
git add .
git commit -m "updated something"
git push
